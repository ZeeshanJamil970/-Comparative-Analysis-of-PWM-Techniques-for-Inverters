# -Comparative-Analysis-of-PWM-Techniques-for-Inverters
Shared my project on "Comparative Analysis of Modulation Techniques for PWM Inverters" using Simulink to convert 350V DC to 220V AC at 50Hz with 5kHz PWM. Explored SPWM, MPWM, Sinusoidal PWM, and Staircase PWM (10 steps), comparing complexity, control, THD, and frequency spectrum.
